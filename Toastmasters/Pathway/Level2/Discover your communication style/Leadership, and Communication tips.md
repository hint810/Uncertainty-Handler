In the last post, I talked about what the leader needs to do in action (Leader is ...)

Let me elaborate it one more time

First, Leader should listen to the people, not only they listen to the others, it's important that people around him feel comfortable approaching the leaders to talk.

Second, Leader should be there when people are in need of help, it means the leader can provide the solution for certain issues and even if not, they should stand beside the people so that they don't feel alone.

Third, Leaders should understand the effort of the people, regardless of the result, whether it's success or failure in the project, they should remember the blood, sweat, and tears of their people.

OK, that was what leaders do, then I have a question, can you see one common skill needed for these?

It's communication skills. without good communication skills, you can not do such things.

There are a bunch of other things to have good communication but today, I would like to share 2 good tips when it comes to communication in your group.

Let's talk about information sharing or feedback first.

We usually say that giving constructive feedback is a good thing, right? but did you know that if you don't know the appropriate way, it may not be as effective as you think. Although you have good intentions, you may hurt other people's feelings and end up they don't want to ask feedback anymore.

Let's say, I am a leader in the team and I encourage members to give feedback to each other whether it's possible. Because it's a good thing.

So one day, Team had a problem and one of the members came up with the idea after a week and he asked his colleagues for the feedback. But we found that whenever his colleague tells something about that idea, he becomes very defensive because that was the solution after he spends an entire week of research. and he even thought that maybe feedback was not that helpful to him at the end.

How about this one?

Same but different one day, one of the members faced the issue and he wanted the best solution, but he couldn't choose what's the best solution for it yet, so he brought multiple ideas after a day and asked his colleagues for feedback. this time somehow his team members suggested a couple of thoughts on each idea and after discussion with them, he could have one solution. He really felt that feedback from colleagues was great and helpful.

Can you see the differences?

In a first example, person asking for help thought very deeply and asked feedback for the best solution(in his thought!) or the only solution, and because he thought it's the only option, he felt like "he is" that "solution", so when other people said something to that solution and if it's little bit negative, he felt he was under attack.

but in 2nd example, because it was multiple ideas and he got all the possible opinions on each, he didn't consider "the solution" as himself, so he didn't feel hurt and in the end, he could have a best possible solution.

Simply put, using multiple items when asking feedback is much better to build trust in the team than talking about single item

second tip, it's for when you persuade other people,

When you need to convince the other people to do something new, what do you do first?

do you try to gather the data of why it's good? so that you can show them it's some kind of must-have item or must do things for them?

You may think that giving them the best reason to do is the key but somehow it's not true.

let me give you an example,

I want to introduce a new system and tools to my team, so I set up the meeting with all the PLs and managers to convince them that this is the best for us.

however, after I explained to them all, one of manager told me like this.



was it used in the USA?, I said yes, then he said, I thought so, you know Korea is different from the USA.

later I explained example from Korea, then he asked again, was it from this industry?, I said yes, then he said, I thought so, you know this industry is different from that one.

so one more time, I explained the example of this industry, then again he asked question, was it X company?, I said yes, then he said, I thought so, you know our company is different from that one.



what's the problem with him? in this case, it doesn't matter how good that tool or system is for them if they don't trust you,



So the first thing you need to do is? trust building with those whom you need to persuade.



Do you think this tips helpful? I hope so.

Conclusion, I got this insight from a book called "함께자라기, 애자일로 가는길" ( Growing up together, on the way to Agile.) by Chang Jun, Kim. and I appreciate to the auther as this book was full of insight.



I believe that growing is not just for young children, but to all of us. And communication is always the key to learn from others. Let's not stop growing.

Thanks
