2019 was the year that I had some kind of transition in my Toastmaster Journey. Do you know why? Let me tell you why.

But to explain all these details, I need to get back to the eariest time of my Toastmaster Journey.

Some of you may know that I started Toastmaster around 7 years ago, do you know why? it's same reason with many of you, to be a better english speaker maybe.

So last 7 years, I tried to become better speaker and better leader in Toastmasters club.

But at first, Actually I was worried about my English ability, because I was not confident about how to write the script and how to speak what I wanted.

Later, I realized that it was not all, I needed to study more about how to use voice and body, where to see for eye contact and how to engage with audience. Thanks to the club members, I could learn about them. I've learned from Indu, Manmohan and Dev and so on. I even learned by doing things that are required on the way to now which was very nice.

Couple of years passed, during this time, I served as Seceretary, Surgeant at arm, VPM, VPE and so on. So as you can guess, I've learned leadership as well. It was fun fun experiences.

One year, during the time I serve as president, I especially grew a lot. Because there were so many things that I needed to decide and do and share. 

by doing challenging activity at that time, with many support and mentoring of X presidents and friends, I've learned the life.  I really felt that I was growing. (not phisically but mentally)

And march of this year , after I finish the presidential terms, I thought  I should I do something else. It was the time that I also felt that I need some sort of breakthrough at work, because I was stuck on some stage somehow and I felt that I am not growing professionally neither.

It was vague to me actually, regarding what to do, but after I went through 3 different experiences, I realized that I can still use Toastmaster to move foward.

Let me tell you about what were the event that I went through.

one, many failure  - software certification test and one achievement "best reviewer" at work, you know it's critically important to achieve something at work because my life depend on it and there were up & down  and to be honest with you, I am still struggling. But I felt that the how people see me was changed after I got "best reviewer" although it's not a something that are critically good.

two, I had Job interview, first time in last 13 years, couple of weeks ago, I didn't want to move the company but that was kind of putting my self in the real job market to know if I am worth to sell.
The result is, it gave me insight that what I thought I did in my team was not what I did, but mostly, it was what my colleagues did and I just did small part of it.

three, Pathway - Kyungtae's project, I had hornor of being mentor for his project, and he enlighented me that we can do project in Toastmasters not only for the public speaking or leadership but deepening special knowledge as well

and while I was going through this kind of events, I realized that I should have the contents. The contents that people want to know and I am fully aware of. The contents that I can talk without hesitation even when I woke up in the mid night. The contents that I can use at work and can be recognized by other people that he is able to do his job in his level.

Then What should I do for next? 

1st, I was thinking to do similar project like Kyungtae, but my case will be a bit different, It' will not be like specialized in on category like AI, but I want to talk about the big IT issues and record them and share it in SOTM community  I don't know how many but I think while I study with other members and prepare those thing, people who joined can learn more about them, I don't meant to be the expert on it, but I think I can widen the knowledge that are necessary in IT fields

2nd, this is what I realized after I had interview, what I'm doing does not mean that I do it all by myself, which means I don't know everything about it.
As software engineer, you may had a dream of working in Top 5 company world wide, and in order to do that, there are couple of things that I need to prepare.

but I don't meant to move to that company, Just I want to prepare myself for the situation, you know maybe in the future, you may need to go

learn about what to do and how to do Coding interview, Behavior interview, tech knowledge, System Design in English 

So... if there are people who are interested in this, I will make small group for it and start it together maybe ðŸ™‚

Toastmasters changed my life, I can not think of my life without it now. Because It was challenge, play ground/friends and school to me. 

I don't know how it will be changed later, but certainly I know one thing, there will be always, my mentor who will inspire me to move foward

Thanks
