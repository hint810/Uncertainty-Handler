23rd of September, 2019, BBC Two posted a word of the day on facebook.

And it was Kkondae, Korean word that describes the older person who believes they are always right(and you are always wrong)
From my understanding, the definition of Kkondae is exactly opposite to Leader.
because they are stubborn, inflexible and never listen to the others.

Then what kind of person can be considered as a leader? Here I want to share how I see a leader.
You can guess from what we talked, the opposite characters of Kkondae.

	1. Leaders listen to you, if a team member has something that they want to talk, whether it's for the coaching, solution for the problem, or sharing the emotion, leaders usually have time to listen to them because leaders want to look after their friends, family, and coworkers. And to do that they need to understand the people around them, so they listen to you.
	
	2. Leaders try to find the solution together when you struggle, although they may not have the solution for all, they will not leave you alone because they want you to get through.
	
	3. Leaders may request you for the complete success of work, but at the same time, they never forget the blood and tears and sweat of you, because, without you all, they will never be the leaders.


so, the Leader is the person who listens to you in any circumstances, helps you find the solution together when you are in need of help and maybe never forget to reward you for the hard work even when you fail.
How do you think?

Many people metions that there are much different leadership style, but if you do the 3 things above then I think it doesn't matter what types of leader you are(knowing the types of leadership is still important though), because I believe you can adjust your self to any types of leadership based on the circumstances.

Let me share one story, about 8 years ago, I was a member for Mr. Jang, let's just say Mr. Jang because I don't think I can mention his real name.

anyway, at that time he was the Project leader and I was the member of his team.
He was the person who thought the work and success of project were more important than the relationship with others.
One Saturday night, he and I were sitting down in the office, head to head, talking about what to do with one problem from an issue management system. 

Although it was Saturday night, he wanted to resolve that issues so that he could do PRA which is the final step of product release on next Monday. So he called one person who he never met before and ask him to come to the office to fix the problem.
It didn't seem right to me, so I said why don't you do it on Monday? but what he said as respond was somehow, I can never forget even now. 

"Let me do what I can do, calling and asking him if he can fix it before Monday. whether he says yes or no, I should at least try what I can do because, without it, I can not say I did my best, Just one call..."

Before I listen to him, I thought doing my best was something I always need to do, but after that happen, I got confused.
Because, in that situation, if I do my best, somehow the other person become unhappy.

Working hard for something that we don't care about is called stress and working hard for something that we love is called passion
At that time, Mr. Jang may think the project schedule was just cause, because he thought that it was the most important thing. but as a person who watched them, I think what he did was just giving that person stress, because the person who got a call to come to the office doesn't seem to care of what he did. definitely he was not happy about the situation.

Mr. Jang may accomplished the the project goal, but can he be considered a leader? 
I know that leaders try to keep the "Momentum" of their team, because, with that, they can continue to get closer to the success. But they need to be careful when it comes to intensity vs consistency because if they want to achieve the long term goal, because they will live longer than just one project, consistency should have higher priority than intensity. And that consistency can not be kept if the members are not happy.

Leadership is like a wind.

You don't feel it exist until the grass is laying down or leaves are swayed.
Same to the Leadership, you may not think it's important or you don't even feel the power of it when everything is normal, but if you experience something with leaders, you know it's there and you will feel that you are in a safer place than before. Because that's what leaders do.
